Use something like cross-env on windows environments: npm cross-env
From what I can find, this appears to fall into the 'Windows issues
with NODE_ENV' category. Setting the NODE_ENV separately, 
prior to starting the app results in the environment working
correctly; any manipulation of NODE_ENV inside a package.json 
script on its own results in failure.
This answer on another question led me to the package cross-env,
and when implemented as identified in the answer resolves the issue.
